##First Run

My first run took me close to 2-1/2 hours.  I used the hints to guide me along the way and ran into trouble after I thought my "as" section in my routes.rb was breaking my code and ended up taking those out.  However, I learned that I do in fact need those, as they determine what my prefixes will be for my path (when I thought the prefixes determined the "as" label).  Next time around, I'll definitely keep that in mind.
