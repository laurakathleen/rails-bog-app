##Timed Runs
Over the course of my four timed runs, my time decreased pretty tremendously.  My first run took close to 2-1/2 hours, while my last run took about 45 minutes.  A mistake that I got tripped up on during my first run was my "as" labels pertaining to my routes.  I didn't realize that these labels actually make your routes when you run rails routes and then play a key role in your redirect_to within your controller.  My longest trip up during my last run was getting my form_for syntax down correctly.
